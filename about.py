            <h2>Image Converter Help</h2>
            <p>This application allows you to convert JPG/JPEG/PNG/BMP images to WEBP format with quality control.</p>

            <h3>Basic Controls</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ðŸ“‚Load Image</strong> - Open an image file from your computer</li>
                <li><strong>ðŸ’¾Save Image</strong> - Save the converted image to your computer</li>
                <li><strong>âž•/âž–</strong> - Zoom in and out of the images</li>
                <li><strong>Quality Slider</strong> - Adjust the compression quality (higher values = better quality but larger file size)</li>
                <li><strong>Drag and Drop</strong> - You can also drag image files directly onto the main window to open them</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Advanced Options</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Method</strong> - Select the conversion algorithm (0-6). Higher values provide better quality and smaller file size but take longer to process.</li>
                <li><strong>Lossless</strong> - Enable for lossless compression (no quality loss, but larger file size)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Image Navigation</h3>
            <p>You can drag the images to pan around, and use the zoom controls to get a closer look at details.</p>
